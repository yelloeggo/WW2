            <h1> My Thoughts </h1>
            <p> Life is a very strange and unique concept. It can be described as a person travelling the world with their family and starting a collection of souvenirs, but it can also be seen as a person sitting in a dark corner dwelling over their past and feeling frustrated. Life looks different for everyone, and it can quickly change, especially during the most unexpected times. Everyone is responsible for their own lives and they have full control on what their lives will look like in the future. Life is simply the outcome of the choices that have been made in the past. A person’s life a year from today will be based on the choices they make today. If one always works hard and remains consistent with their goals, they will likely build progress and be on track to succeed. On the other hand, one who is constantly waiting for the right time to begin, is wasting their life away, and will likely keep on waiting for the next ten years. </p>
            <p> “Everything happens for a reason.” There will always be a reason for all the obstacles and successes that one approaches during their life. Success is always deserved. Even if one did not work hard to achieve a certain goal, there may be other factors that have contributed to their success. Maybe one has humbly completed an act of kindness, or needed a boost of confidence to reach another goal. Any difficulties or roadblocks one may encounter are also well deserved. One may likely need to pay back sins from bad choices that they have made in their past. No one is perfect, there will never be a person in this world who will always know what all the best decisions are. All difficulties are important to look back on. They serve as valuable lessons that are unique to oneself, and are created to improve and bring out the best in them. Karma exists, and even if the reason is not clear right away, it will all make more sense in the future. </p>
            <p> Join me to explore these ideas more in depth and learn more about the world as I grow and mature as a person. </p>
